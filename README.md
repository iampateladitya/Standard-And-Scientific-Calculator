# Standard-And-Scientific-Calculator



Description of my project
This project is a C++ implementation of a Standard Scientific Calculator that offers both basic arithmetic operations and scientific functions. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface where users can input mathematical expressions and get accurate results.

The calculator consists of two main modes:

1. Standard Mode:
    In this mode, users can perform standard arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator ensures precise calculations and handles various input formats.
   

3. Scientific Mode: 
    In this mode, users have access to advanced scientific functions such as:
Power (x^y): Calculate the power of a given number 'x' raised to the exponent 'y.'
Logarithms (log base x): Compute the logarithm of a number with a given base 'x.'
Square Root (âˆšx): Find the square root of a given positive number 'x.'
Reciprocal (1/x): Obtain the reciprocal of a non-zero number 'x.'


3. User Input:
    After running the calculator, it will display a prompt for user input.
    Enter your mathematical expression, either in standard notation or using scientific functions (e.g., 2 + 3, 4 * 5, 10 / 2, pow(2, 3), sqrt(16), log(100), 1 / 5).

   
5. Output:
   The calculator will evaluate the expression and display the result accurately.
